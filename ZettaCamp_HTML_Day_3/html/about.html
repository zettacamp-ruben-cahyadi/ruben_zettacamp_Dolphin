                In the corridors of academia, the company's founders, Ruben and Mark, discovered a shared passion for the boundless possibilities that technology offered. 
                Their friendship was forged over late-night discussions, a fusion of coding, and an unquenchable thirst for innovation. After years of honing their skills and gaining industry insights, 
                they knew it was time to turn their dreams into reality.
